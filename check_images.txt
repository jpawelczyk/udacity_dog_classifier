Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All three model architectures correctly identified the dog breed as 'Rottweiler'


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: VGG and ResNet correctly identified both images as 'Rottweiler', however, AlexNet incorrectly classified the 2nd image as 'kelpie'


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All three model architectures correctly classified Turtle_01.jpg and Stethoscope_01.jpg as 'not-a' dog


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Performance of VGG and ResNet was equivalent, however, ResNet seems to be faster
